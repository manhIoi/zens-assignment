# Zens Assignment - Joke App

This repository contains an implementation of a Joke App along with an algorithm for finding the minimum and maximum sums of four integers from a given set of five positive integers.

## Algorithm

### How to run?

```bash
cd algorithm && node index.js
```

### Description

The algorithm takes an array of five positive integers as input and calculates the minimum and maximum sums that can be obtained by summing exactly four out of the five integers. It then prints the respective minimum and maximum sums as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

## Mobile App

### Setup

```bash
cd JokeApp && yarn
```

For iOS, you need to install the pods:

```bash
cd ios && pod install
```

For more detailed setup instructions, please refer to the [React Native Documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

### How to run?

Android:

```bash
yarn android
```

iOS:

```bash
yarn ios
```

### Description

The mobile app is a simple Joke App that displays jokes fetched from an API. Users can tap on the "Next Joke" button to view a new joke. The app supports both Android and iOS platforms.
